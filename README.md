# Udemy

This is my first React project which is still under development. It is a Udemy (https://www.udemy.com) cloned website. You will be able to see all the front end coding in src.zip while the back end part stored in the separate app.js file. All the back end data for example courses are currently stored on AWS Cloud either in S3 backet or RDS database.
